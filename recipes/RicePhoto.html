    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      According to history when the Nawabs moved from Dhaka to Bengal, they
      introduced Awadhi Cuisine to Bengalis. Chicken Chaap was one of those
      Mughlai delicacies which got popularized with time. The city restaurants
      played an important role, in where the masses got to taste Mughlai
      cuisine. And later the same dishes because people liked the taste so much
      started taking distinct place on Wedding and Party menus.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 kg- 6 Chicken full leg pieces</li>
      <li>1 tsp- Kashmiri mirch powder</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>150 g- Yogurt (whisked)</li>
      <li>½ cup- Ghee/Clarified butter</li>
      <li>4 large sized- Onion</li>
      <li>10-12- Garlic cloves</li>
      <li>4-5 Green chillies</li>
      <li>One 1½” piece- Ginger</li>
      <li>¼ cup- Fresh grated coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add everything mentioned For the Spice Powder in a food processor and
        make a coarse powder, keep aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add everything mentioned For the Spice Paste in a food processor and
        blitz until smooth paste forms, keep aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now in a large bowl add the chicken pieces, kashmiri mirch powder,
        yogurt, ½ tsp salt, spice powder, and spice paste. Mix well & marinate
        for 3-4 hours or you can marinate the chicken overnight and cook the
        next day.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat ghee in a kadai/deep frying pan (nonstick preferably), add the
        marinated chicken along with the marination, mix well, cover and cook
        over low heat until the chicken is thoroughly cooked. Adjust salt, keep
        stirring in between. I cooked the Chaap without water but if you feel
        that the gravy is drying up too much you can add some hot water in
        between the cooking.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot with Parota, Rumali Roti, Biryani or Pulao.</li>
    </ol>
