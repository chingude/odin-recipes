    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h2>ROOT-TO-LEAF TREND</h2>
    <p>
    Also known as root-to-fruit, this trend has seen chefs such as Tom Hunt of Bristol’s Poco 
    and Douglas McMaster of Brighton’s Silo adopt a zero-waste policy. One way to easily 
    achieve this is using the whole vegetable in the creation of a dish, so nothing 
    is destined for the bin. Cauliflower lends itself to this treatment really well as  
    the leaves crisp up beautifully once roasted.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 small caulflower, leaves trimmed off and reserved</li>
      <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>750mk vegetable stock</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
      <li>white pepper</li>
      <li>450g spaghetti</li>
      <li>4 tbsp pine nuts, toasted</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Step 1</h3>
        Heat the oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Toss the cauli leaves with 1
        tbsp of olive oil, season and spread on a non-stick baking tray. Roast
         for 10-12 minutes or until the leaf stems are tender and the leaves are a
          little crispy at the edges.
      </li>
      <li><h3>Step 2</h3>
        Break the cauliflower into florets and cut the stalk into small pieces, then put in a pan with the stock, 
        garlic and 2 tbsp of olive oil. Bring to a simmer, 
        cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the cauli and garlic are very soft.
        </li>
        <li><h3>Step 3</h3>
          Scoop out the cauli and garlic into a blender and blitz, adding enough cooking liquid to give a sauce the 
          texture of double cream. Pour back into the pan and season really well with salt and white pepper.
        </li>
        <li><h3>Step 4</h3>
          Cook the pasta following pack instructions. Drain then toss with the cauli sauce.
           Serve sprinkled with the cauli leaves and pine nuts.
        </li>
    </ol>
